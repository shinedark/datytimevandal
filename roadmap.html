			<h3>Outline</h3>
			<p>
				Daytime Vandal is a NFT Project created by Shine Dark. It's a space for
				creation of art and it's formats, tied to technology in the web3 space.
				The plan is to create replicable applications for other to use or take
				guidance from. I'm a one man army so timelines may vary depending on my
				obligations in the real world. The point of this project it to collect
				enough funds via NFT's available in stores, for development and
				creation.
